Vintage Analysis measures portfolio performance for different periods of registration. Basically, it's concern about loan/credit risk and a certain time period. Banking often used vintage analysis to quantify the credit risk of customers. Furthermore, it could help to create a target label for a supervised machine learning problem. We can identify how many months from the registration date that customers will change their status to default/bad credit. Bad credit defines as customers that overdue their credit card debt more than 90 days or with status 3, 4, or 5.
